## Experience


### Personal Projects

Iâ€™m a Mathematics PhD turned enthusiastic programmer who sees software development as both a hobby and a career choice.
I'm currently working as a software developer at a small start up called AlliedCrowds.
My [GitHub](https://github.com/mauicv) and [Blog](https://www.mauicv.com) also include a number of personal projects I've been working on.

- mauicv.com, a blog with articles about some of my explorations into machine learning, reinforcement learning and mathematics.
- I've recently been learning about [Generative Adversarial Networks](https://www.mauicv.com/machine-learning/2020/07/22/generative-adversarial-networks-faces.html).
- [Reinforcement learning solutions](https://github.com/mauicv/openai-gym-solns) to openai gym environments. Namely Policy Gradient, DQN and Actor Critic algorithms.
- A [physics engine](https://github.com/mauicv/genesis-tubs-engine) built from scratch in JavaScript. Available on npm [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/genesis-tubs-engine).
- Completed the [TensorFlow in Practice specialization](https://coursera.org/share/992bff6d94a39de26e755ce0e6464250) on coursera.
- To ease the creation of projects with this engine I built an [electron app](https://github.com/mauicv/genesis-tubs-builder) with a intuitive UI.
- www.genesistubs.com is a Vuejs GitHub pages website that demonstrates some of the games I've developed with the genesis-tubs-engine.
- A [flask app](https://bitbucket.org/mauicv/limos/src/master) which runs on a digital ocean server monitoring tickers on IEX. Whenever a symbol behaves unusually it emails me to tell so.
- I've also been developing a messenger phone application written in dart and flutter. This has given me experience using web-sockets and google-cloud-storage.

### Current Employment

AlliedCrowds is a small start up with currently only 5 employees. I am one of the two software developers working there and the small size of our team has allowed me to show that I'm a highly dependable and responsible asset. During my time there I've worked in depth with:

  1. Python, Flask and Eve with PostgreSQL via SQL-alchemy.
  2. Testing frameworks such as nose2 and pytest.
  3. database maintenance via python scripts written in Juypter notebooks or just SQL.
  4. NLP and ML via gensim and scikit-learn
  5. JavaScipt alongside Vuejs, Vuex, Vue Router, TestCafe and Mocha
  6. Node along with a wide range of npm Packages, including experience developing and publishing our own.
  7. HTML and css.
  8. Authorisation flows such as OAuth and Stripe card payment functionality.
  9. GitHub pages, Heroku and digital ocean.
  11. Continuous integration using technology such as Travis CI as well as good practices in Testing, linting and git work flow methodologies.
  12. For server application development I use vagrant machines with ubuntu installed.

My role at AlliedCrowds ranged from full stack developer to data engineering/science. Projects I have worked on include:

- A [crowdfunding platform](www.isdb-innovate.org) written in vuejs with a back end built in Eve.
- A dashboard website for a database asset AlliedCrowds maintains.
- An [API controller](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alliedcrowds/capital-finder-api) that makes using the Capital Finder API easy. This is now used behind a number of AlliedCrowds Capital-Finder websites.
- A [Veux store](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@alliedcrowds/capital-finder-vuex) that utilises the API controller.
- A command line tool that helps run a data pipeline, from scraping website html, processing the text, using gensim for topic analysis and finally generating reports. The final processed data is either used to help the analysts at AlliedCrowds write up reports or is used to update and maintain a database asset AlliedCrowds owns.
- I also helped build [make-it](https://make-it.alliedcrowds.com) and completely built [ghanacic](http://investors.ghanacic.org/#/).
- I've also built an annuity calculator which is hosted on the allied crowds site [here](https://www.alliedcrowds.com/pension).
- I'm currently working on a [directory of carbon offsetting projects](alliedoffsets.com)

## Goals

While I enjoy building websites for my personal projects I'm keen to move away from web development and focus instead on my interests in data science and machine learning. These skill sets pair well with my strong mathematical background.

While working at a small company has been great fun and an incredible learning experience. It's small size has meant that I haven't had a chance to experience and learn from working in a team as a software developer. This is something I'm really excited to do.

I like to build things and also the tools that build things.

## Personal Character

I'm honest, hard-working and likeable. I spend my free time socialising, bouldering, playing guitar and reading. My greatest joy in life is good food with good friends.
