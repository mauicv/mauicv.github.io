  topic: reinforcement-learning
  excerpt: >
    So I've recently started looking at Reinforcement learning in my spare time because it just seems like a pretty powerful tool. I feel like I sort of threw myself in the deep end in that I have no experience with any of the usual machine learning...

  excerpt: >
    So graphs are made up of nodes and edges. We're going to build on top of a graph a random dynamical system that's going to move around on it known as a random walk. By doing so and recording each of the steps the random dynamical...

  excerpt: >
    The reinforcement learning problem is made up of a state space, and actor and a policy. The actor transitions between states in the state space on the basis of the  actions it's taking at those states. The actions it chooses to take are selected by the policy...

    We're going to build a slightly simpler notion of graph here than in part 1. Firstly its going to be bidirectional so a connection between nodes a and b corresponds to a connection between b and a. Instead of building a graph out of text I'm going...

  excerpt: >
    When writing a code base with sufficiently complex class structures a problem that can arise is that when such complex class structures get themselves into an invalid state it can be many lines of code before that invalid state generates an error...

    So a couple of months ago I had an idea to try and test different types of exploration noise in ddpg environments. The original ddpg paper suggests using an Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck process for exploration...

  topic: machine-learning
  excerpt: >
    Ages ago, when I first got into machine learning I set out trying to train a GAN. GANs are tricky to train because they're so unstable so I tried using variational autoencoders instead. VAEs are very stable but if you've ever trained one you'll...

  excerpt: >
    In this post we'll focus on improving the variational autoencoder. Specifically, we'll be using a vector quantized VAE (VQ-VAE) to improve the quality of the latent space. VQ-VAEs are introduced in the paper Neural Discrete Representation Learning...
