My names Alex, I'm a software developer currently working in a fintech start up in london. Professionally I'm something in between a full stack and a data engineer.

Prior to being a software engineer I obtained a PhD from imperial college london, studying dynamical systems.

This blog is mostly about my faulty understanding of software, mathematics and data science.
