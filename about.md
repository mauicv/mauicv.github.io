My names Alex, I'm a software developer currently working in a fin-tech start up in London. Professionally I'm currently something in between a full stack and a data engineer. Prior to being a software engineer I obtained a PhD from Imperial College London, studying dynamical systems.

This blog is mostly about my faulty understanding of software, mathematics, data science and machine learning. If anything I say throughout is wrong please feel free to email me to let me know!

<sup>__Note__ : I'm dyslexic and so some of my spelling and grammar is pretty bad. I had the choice of this either being an easy and quick process for creating and sharing content or a slow and unpleasant one that's going to put me off writing. I chose the former because I'd rather put things out than sit on them trying to make them perfect.</sup>
