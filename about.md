My names Alex, I'm a research engineer currently working at [seldon.io](https://www.seldon.io/) on [explainable AI](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) and [drift](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect). Prior to this I obtained a PhD from Imperial College London, studying dynamical systems.

This blog is mostly about my faulty understanding of software, mathematics, data science and machine learning.

<sup>__Note__ : I'm dyslexic and so some of my spelling and grammar is pretty bad. I had the choice of this either being an easy and quick process for creating and sharing content or a slow and unpleasant one that's going to put me off writing. I chose the former because I'd rather put things out than sit on them trying to make them perfect.</sup>
