My names Alex, I'm a research engineer currently working at [seldon.io](https://www.seldon.io/) on [explainable AI](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi) and [drift](https://github.com/SeldonIO/alibi-detect). Prior to this I worked for a [start up](https://alliedoffsets.com/) that built databases of carbon-offsetting projects. Even prior to that, I obtained a PhD from Imperial College London, studying dynamical systems.

This blog is mostly about my faulty understanding of software, mathematics, data science and machine learning.

Feel free to email me at: alexander.athorne@gmail.com if you have any questions or discover some egregious error that can't go uncorrected. I'm also on [twitter](https://twitter.com/oblibob) but I don't use it except to post links, and i'm on [github](https://github.com/mauicv) if you want to see my code.

<sup>__Note__ : I'm dyslexic and so some of my spelling and grammar is pretty bad. I had the choice of this either being an easy and quick process for creating and sharing content or a slow and unpleasant one that's going to put me off writing. I chose the former because I'd rather put things out than sit on them trying to make them perfect.</sup>
