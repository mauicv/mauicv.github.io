### Projects I'm actively working on

- Building a robot using an ardunio controller and creating a control system using reinforcement learning algorithms

### Projects I might work on one day

- Testing Style Transfer for the discriminator model trained in my efforts to get a GAN to create images of faces.
- Using a Multi Scale Gradient GAN to generate doodles in the style of me.


### Abandoned Projects:

- Using one of policy gradient or actor critic to train bipedal walkers built in the [genesistubs-physics-engine](https://github.com/mauicv/genesis-tubs-engine).
  - I've decided to abandon this. The main reason being that I'm suffering sunk cost fallacy w.r.t the physics engine. I feel like becuase I've made it I need to use it but it's turning into a giant time sink and I really want to focus on other things I can see greater value in.
