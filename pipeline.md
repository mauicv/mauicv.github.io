### Projects I'm working on currently

- Using one of policy gradient or actor critic to train bipedal walkers built in the [genesistubs-physics-engine](https://github.com/mauicv/genesis-tubs-engine).
- Testing Style Transfer for the discriminator model trained in my efforts to get a GAN to create images of faces.
- Using a Multi Scale Gradient GAN to generate doodles in the style of me.
